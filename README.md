# CODALAB: ACRE Cascade Competition

ACRE stands for "Agri-food Competition for Robot Evaluation". This competition, hosted by CodaLab, is part of the METRICS project (Metrological Evaluation and Testing of Robots in International Competitions), funded from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program.
The competition consists in designing an algorithm to distinguish and identify the position of weeds within plantations, so that they could be mechanically removed by robots, avoiding the use of pesticides. 
The algorithm receives crop images as input and must be able to provide masks in which the various components are distinguished by different colors, as shown in the figure (segmentation task).
